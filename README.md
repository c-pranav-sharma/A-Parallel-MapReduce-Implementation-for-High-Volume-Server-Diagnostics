In the domain of large-scale system administration, efficient processing of massive server log files is critical for real-time threat detection and health monitoring. Traditional sequential processing methods fail to meet the performance latency requirements when handling gigabytes of unstructured log data. This project implements a high-performance, custom MapReduce framework using Python’s multiprocessing capabilities to parallelize the analysis of server access logs.
The system architecture utilizes a "Divide and Conquer" methodology, partitioning raw log streams into discrete data chunks distributed across available CPU cores. A regular-expression-based Mapper parses unstructured text to extract IP addresses and HTTP status codes, while a centralized Reducer aggregates these intermediate metrics into a unified report. The implementation demonstrates a significant reduction in processing time compared to sequential execution, effectively identifying security anomalies (frequent attackers) and system failures (error rate spikes) in simulated high-traffic environments. This tool serves as a foundational model for distributed computing concepts applied to cybersecurity and data engineering.
